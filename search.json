    "text": "Developing the Data Catalog\nThe ACEP Data Catalog is run on a VM hosted by RCS. Extensions can be updated by pushing to the acepportal-ckan GitHub repository. After pushing, changes take ~30 min to update on the main site.\n\nBasic Docker Commands\nList all running containers:\n\ndocker ps -a\n\nThere are 5 containers that run the data catalog\n\nacep-ckan-cont\nacep-db-cont\nacep-redis-cont\nacep-solr-cont\nacep-datapusher-cont\n\nSpin up Application\n\ndocker compose up\n\nThis will turn the terminal into an output stream for the docker containers.\n\nTIP: I recommend keeping two terminal open: one for the output stream so you can see errors, and another to run other commands in\n\nRebuild and spin up containers:\n\ndocker compose up -d --build\n\nRun this command after installing a new extension and adding it to the .env file.\nGo into container:\n\ndocker exec -it [container_name] /bin/bash\n\nOr if bash is not installed in the container:\n\ndocker exec -it [container_name] /bin/sh\n\nOr if in a bash terminal:\n\ndocker exec -it [container_name] bash\n\nRestart a container:\n\ndocker restart [container_name]\n\nRestart the acep-ckan-cont container after making changes to non-HTML files. Changes in html files can be seen by refreshing the webpage.\nTake Down Application\n\ndocker compose down\n\nClean up Project\n\ndocker compose down --rmi all -v --remove-orphans\n\nThis removes all containers, images, and volumes associated with a project. Only do this if you want to clean up your environment and reset the containers.\n\n\nCreating a Local Instance\nCreating a local version of the data catalog is a useful tool for developing and testing new features.\n\nInstall Docker: https://www.docker.com/get-started/\n\nClone the ACEP CKAN repository from Github: https://github.com/UAF-RCS/acepportal-ckan.git\nCreate the .env file inside the main acepportal-ckan folder. Copy the contents from the .env.example file.\nSpecify the location of the source files, storage files, backups, etc. in the .env file. You will move those files to these locations in the next steps. For example:\n# CKAN Mounts Directory\nCKAN_EXTENSIONS_MOUNT=./ckan-extension\nSRC_EXTENSIONS_PATH=/srv/app/src_extensions\nCKAN_SOURCE_MOUNT=./ckan-src/src\nCKAN_STORAGE_MOUNT=./ckan-src/storage\nCKAN_INI_MOUNT=./ckan-src/ckan.ini\nTo create a replica of the current main Data Catalog, copy over the source files, storage files, ckan.ini file, and database backups from the VM. These files are located on the VM inside /opt/ckan/backups. Use scp to copy the files onto your machine. These backups are created everyday: replace [date] with the most recent date in the format yyyymmdd.\nInside of acepportal-ckan/ckan-src run the following\n\nscp user@portal.lab.acep.uaf.edu:/opt/ckan/backups/app_[date].tar.bz2 .\n\nscp user@portal.lab.acep.uaf.edu:/opt/ckan/backups/app_storage_[date].tar.bz2 .\nscp user@portal.lab.acep.uaf.edu:/opt/ckan/acepportal-ckan/ckan-src/ckan.ini\n\nUse tar to decompress the source and storage tar files\n\ntar -jxvf app_[date].tar.bz2\ntar -jxvf app_storage_[date].tar.bz2\n\nDecompressing the app_storage tar file should create a folder called ckan containing the folders resources, storage, and webassets. Rename the ckan folder to storage.\nThis should result in the directory structure specified in ckan-src/README.txt\nCreate a backups folder alongside the acepportal-ckan repository on your machine. Specify the name in the BACKUP_TO setting in the .env file.\n# Backups \nBACKUP_TO=../../[backups folder name]\nRun the following commands inside the backups folder to copy over the database and datastore.\n\nscp user@portal.lab.acep.uaf.edu:/opt/ckan/backups/ckandb_[date].tar .\nscp user@portal.lab.acep.uaf.edu:/opt/ckan/backups/datastore_[date].tar .\n\nInside of the ckan.ini file, set the ckan.site_url setting to the localhost url as so:\nckan.site_url = http://127.0.0.1:5000\nBuild the containers using,\n\ndocker compose up\n\nOnce the containers are up, use the import_database.sh bash script to import the database.\n\nbash import_database.sh\n\nRebuild the CKAN search index.\n\ndocker exec -it acep-ckan-cont /bin/bash\ncd /srv/app\nckan search-index rebuild\n\n\n\n\nCreate a New Extension\n\nEnter the acep-ckan-cont Docker container\n\n\ndocker exec -it acep-ckan-cont /bin/bash and run the following command\nckan generate extension -o /srv/app/src/ckan-extension This will create an extension in the ckan-extension folder which can be edited outside of the container.\n\n\nAdd the extension name to the CKAN_PLUGINS list in the .env file.\nRun docker compose up -d --build ckan\n\n\n\nInstall an Extension\n\nEnsure that the extension supports CKAN 2.10.4 and Python 3.10 Clone the extension repository into the ckan-extension folder.\nEnsure that all dependencies for the extension are listed in requirements.txt or a similar file.\nAdd the extension name to the CKAN_PLUGINS list in the .env file.\nRun docker compose up -d --build ckan\n\n\n\nUpdating the Main Site\nTo add a feature from your local instance to the main Data Catalog,\n\nPush the files to the acepportal-ckan GitHub repository.\nWait about 30 min. for the changes to be pulled to VM.\nIf you have added a new extension, SSH into the VM and add the extension name to the .env file.\n\n\nssh user@portal.lab.acep.uaf.edu\ncd /opt/ckan/acepportal-ckan\nvi .env\n\n\nAfter installing new extensions or making other changes, you may need to restart the acep-ckan-cont container to make them take effect. Inside the VM, run\n\n\ndocker restart acep-ckan-cont",

    "text": "Extensions\n\nCurrently Installed\n\nckanext-customtheme\nAuthor: Jenae Matson\nPurpose: Add custom theming and features for the CKAN instance, including\n\nACEP logos, colors, and fonts\nHome page layout, images, and featured dataset\nChanged font weight of Register button\nAdded tags to search page display\nHTML file for About page text\nRemoved social media links from dataset/resources pages\nAdded support contact info to dataset sidebar\nAdded default blank option to add-to-group dropdown menu\n\n\n\nckanext-dcat\nLink: https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-dcat\nPurpose: Rework metadata to conform to DCAT standard.\nModifications:\n\nThe file schemas/acep_dcat_fields.yaml was created to define the metadata fields for the catalog.\nThe file templates/scheming/form_snippets/publisher.html was created to define the dynamic dropdown menu in the Publisher metadata field.\n\n\n\nckanext-faqpage\nAuthor: Jenae Matson\nPurpose: Create an FAQ page linked in the masthead with collapsible boxes for questions and answers.\n\n\nckanext-geoview\nLink: https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-geoview\nPurpose: Created resource views for geojson and other geo-data file types. We have implemented the OpenLayers Viewer.\n\n\nckanext-githubrepopreview\nLink: https://github.com/DataShades/ckanext-githubrepopreview\nPurpose: Provide a view for GitHub repository resources.\nModifications: This extension was created for an older version of CKAN, so the following changes were made to make it work with version 2.10:\n\nIn the file plugin.py, replace the line from lib import parse with the following\n\nfrom urllib.parse import urlparse\n\ndef parse(input_url, some_flag):\n    parsed_info = {}\n    parsed_url = urlparse(input_url)\n    domain = parsed_url.netloc\n    path_parts = parsed_url.path.strip('/').split('/')\n    \n    parsed_info['domain'] = domain\n    parsed_info['owner'] = path_parts[0] if len(path_parts) &gt; 0 else None\n    parsed_info['repo'] = path_parts[1] if len(path_parts) &gt; 1 else None\n    \n    return parsed_info\n\nIn the file templates/githubrepo.html, delete the following lines\n\n{%- block styles %}\n    {% resource g.main_css[6:] %}\n{% endblock %}\n{%- block scripts %}\n    {% resource 'base/main' %}\n    {% resource 'base/ckan' %}\n    {% if g.tracking_enabled %}\n        {% resource 'base/tracking.js' %}\n    {% endif %}\n{% endblock -%}\n\n\nckanext-package-group-permissions\nLink: https://github.com/salsadigitalauorg/ckanext-package-group-permissions\nPurpose: Allows all editors and admins to add datasets to any group, without having to be added as members to each group.\nModifications: This extension was created and works with CKAN 2.9. This instance is version 2.10, so the extension requires some small modifications to work. The following changes were made to the original extension:\n\nIn the file plugin.py, change the member_create function to the following\n\ndef member_create(self, next_auth, context, data_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    This code is largely borrowed from /src/ckan/ckan/logic/auth/create.py\n    With a modification to allow users to add datasets to any group\n    :param context:\n    :param data_dict:\n    :return:\n    \"\"\"\n    group = logic_auth.get_group_object(context, data_dict)\n\n    authorized = False\n    if not group.is_organization and data_dict.get('object_type') == 'package':\n        authorized = helpers.user_has_admin_access(include_editor_access=True)\n\n    if not authorized:\n        # Fallback to the default CKAN behaviour\n        return next_auth(context, data_dict)\n    else:\n        return {'success': True}\n\nIn the the file templates/package/group_list.html, add the line { h.csrf_input() } to the beginning of the two post forms, as follows\n\n{% if groups %}\n&lt;form class=\"add-to-group\" method=\"post\"&gt;\n    {{ h.csrf_input() }}\n    ...\n&lt;/form&gt;\n{% endif %}\n{% if c.pkg_dict.groups %}\n&lt;form method=\"post\"&gt;\n    {{ h.csrf_input() }}\n    ...\n{% endif %}\n\n\nckanext-pdfview\nLink: https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-pdfview\nPurpose: Provide a view for pdf resources.\n\n\nckanext-restrictpublish\nAuthor: Jenae Matson\nPurpose: Restrict the ability to change the visibility of a dataset to admins only. Datasets posted by editors default to private.\n\n\nckanext-scheming\nLink: https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-scheming\nPurpose: Allows for the creation of alternate metadata templates (schemas) defined by .yaml or .json files.\nModifications: Some of the automatically calculated resource fields were manually re-added to be displayed. In the file templates/scheming/package/resource_read.html, below {%- block resource_license -%} add the following\n{%- block resource_size -%}\n&lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;th scope=\"row\"&gt;{{ _('Size') }}&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;{{ res.size or _('unknown') }} bytes&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n{%- endblock -%}\n{%- block resource_datastore -%}\n&lt;tr&gt;\n    &lt;th scope=\"row\"&gt;{{ _('Datastore active') }}&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;td&gt;{{ res.datastore_active or _('unknown') }}&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n{%- endblock -%}\n\n\n\nAdding Alternate Schemas with ckanext-scheming\n\nCreate a .yaml or .json file in the folder ckanext-scheming/ckanext/scheming to define the metadata schema. See extension documentation for more information and examples.\n\nIn ckan.ini, add your schema(s) to the scheming.dataset_schemas config option. For example:\n\n\nscheming.dataset_schemas = ckanext.scheming:arctic_dataset.json ckanext.scheming:geo_dataset.json\n\nThe new dataset creation form is located at a url defined by the schema type name. For example, the creation form for datasets of type arctic-dataset is located at /arctic-dataset/new. You can define a new Add Dataset button using this new url.\n\n\n\nAttempted Extensions\n\nckanext-spatial\nLink: https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-spatial\nPurpose: This extension adds the ability to search for datasets on a map widget, as well as a dataset extent map widget on the dataset page, provided correct geospatial metadata.\nProblems: This extension is not currently installed due to the following,\n\nConfiguring map tiles for ckanext-spatial caused the map tiles for ckanext-geoview to disappear.\nDatasets with the required spatial metadata were not searchable on the map search widget, although the dataset extent widet worked correctly.\n\n\n\nckanext-oidc-pkce\nLink: https://github.com/DataShades/ckanext-oidc-pkce/tree/master\nPurpose: This extension allows for users to be authenticated through an external application when they login.\nProblems: Ideally users on the ACEP Data Catalog would be able to login using their UA login credentials through Google Authentication. This extension installs correctly, but does not seem to support Google Authentication.",
