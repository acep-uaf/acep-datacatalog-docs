## Searching for Datasets {.unnumbered}
There are many ways to search for datasets in the catalog.

- __Search Bar__  
    Use key words to find datasets, just like Google. On the left sidebar of the search results page, you can filter by tags and other categories to get more specific results.

- __Organizations__  
    Sort by larger categories by looking the __Organization__ tab at the top of the screen.

    - The __ACEP Open Data__ organization holds datasets created and owned by ACEP's research teams.
    - The __ACEP Internal Use__ organization holds datasets that ACEP does not own. These are useful resources for ACEP researchers. __You must be an ACEP employee to gain access to these datasets.__ Contact Liz to get the necessary permissions for your account.
