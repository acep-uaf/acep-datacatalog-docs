Guides for researchers and those posting datasets to the catalog.

## Posting a Dataset {.unnumbered}
There are two ways to access the __Add Dataset__ button:

- Click on the __Datasets__ tab at the top of the screen
- Click on the __Organizations__ tab at the top of the screen and select the organization you want to add a dataset to:
    - Choose __ACEP Open Data__ if you are posting your own data or data that ACEP owns.
    - Choose __ACEP Internal Use__ if you are posting a useful dataset that ACEP does not own.

1. Click on the __Add Dataset__ button above the search bar.
2. On the first page, fill out the metadata fields for your dataset. 
    - For examples and more information about the metadata fields, see the [Metadata Walkthrough](metadata.qmd).

    - Double check the organization field.
        - Choose __ACEP Open Data__ if you are posting your own data or data that ACEP owns.
        - Choose __ACEP Internal Use__ if you are posting a useful dataset that ACEP does not own.
    - If you are a researcher, your dataset's visibility will automatically be set to private. An admin will review your dataset and make it public.
3. Once you have completed the metadata fields, click the __Next: Add Data__ button at the bottom of the form. 
4. On the next page, add the data resources to your dataset.

    - Alternatively, enter a link to where the data is stored, such as a GitHub repository or Google Drive.
5. If you have more resources to add, click the __Save & add another__ button at the bottom of the form. Otherwise click __Finish__ to post your dataset.
